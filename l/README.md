# Final L Page 

Here are the changes made to the final **l** page of the project.

## Changes Implemented
- Added a "Rent Now" button in the catalogue page that links directly to the rent page.
- Applied an orange shadow to all buttons.
- Added a shadow effect to every form input box.
- Updated the index (home) page so that the text (instrument names) under each picture now matches the catalogue page.
- Highlighted the current site/page in the navigation bar to improve user orientation and usability.
- Changed the checkbox in rent form to radio so that you can only choose one option.
